mycircleline.co.uk is a groundbreaking software technology that let's you to mine hundreds of bitcoins at no cost!

well maybe on day ...

For now though is a single page webapp that displays information about trains on the London Circle Line network :)


# Why this website
mycircleline is aimed at people who rely specifically on the Circle Line train to commute.  For example commuters at Liverpool street station heading south know how infrequent the circle line train is on this platform.  With mycircleline they can manage their commute even before leaving the office (the apps show up to three scheduled trains, that's up to 30 mins of heads up!)

Sure you might argue that there are apps that do that for all the lines on the London network.  Well if that's the case then here's another reason for this website: it's just fun to build a web site! :)



# How it works
mycircleline.co.uk is a single page web front end on one end and a Java back end on the other.  The back end polls train data from the london TFL server, applies XML to JSON transformations and serves the data on demand to users who see it in a nicely formatted colourful webpage.

The front end is hosted for free here on GitHub while the backend sits on Amazon EC2.

The website is accessible publicly from the url mentioned above.


Happy code browsing!
